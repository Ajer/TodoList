Simple Console Project which lets a user keep track of different tasks. Every task can be assigned to a project. Tasks can be edited , removed and showed in a list sorted by different values. 
It uses 2 text-files: TaskJson.data for saving the taskdata between runs of application, and MaxId.txt which saves the highest id for the tasks.
The last file is used to simulate a database i.e SQL Server which don't reuse id's in their tables but keeps track of the highest id used when using integers.
