Simple C# Console Project which lets a user keep track of different tasks. Every task can be assigned to a project,
tasks can be edited , removed and showed in a list sorted by different values.

It uses 2 text-files:

TaskJson.data for saving the taskdata between runs of application.
  
MaxId.txt which saves the highest id for the tasks. This file is used to simulate a database i.e SQL Server which don't reuse id's in their tables but keep track of the highest id used.
